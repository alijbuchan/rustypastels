<!--
👋 Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

💡 Quick Tip! As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions → Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "rustypastels" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

**rustypastels** currenlty only for Nova, provides a muted dark colour scheme based on the Kanagawa colour scheme for NeoVim. Kanagawa dark colorscheme was inspired by the colours of the famous painting by Katsushika Hokusai.

rustypastels is based on _kanagawa_ by [rebelot](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim). If you use vim or anything based off of vim...I highly recommend this theme.
